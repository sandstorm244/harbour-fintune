"""Youfish backend: thin wrapper over an external yt-dlp binary + a local media proxy.

The app never pins a yt-dlp version — it shells out to whatever yt-dlp is on the
device, and the user updates that binary themselves. Every call is made from
PyOtherSide's worker thread, so blocking subprocess calls are fine here.

Playback note: googlevideo rejects GStreamer's default `souphttpsrc` User-Agent
with HTTP 403, and QtMultimedia's MediaPlayer can't set request headers. So the
prototype player streams through a tiny localhost proxy (below) that refetches the
real URL with a browser User-Agent and forwards byte ranges. This reuses
QtMultimedia's rendering; the raw dual-track GStreamer player (M1, for 720p) will
set headers itself and won't need the proxy.

IMPORTANT (2026 reality): yt-dlp increasingly needs a Proof-of-Origin (PO) token
to return real formats — without one you get "no video format available". The PO
token is minted by a bgutil provider on a bundled Deno/Node runtime; wiring that
sidecar is milestone M2. For now yt-dlp's android_vr client resolves without one.
